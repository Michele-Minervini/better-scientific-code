> *"Code is not just a tool for calculation; it is the language in which we express our scientific logic."*

## 📖 About

This repository serves as a living knowledge base documenting my journey toward becoming a well-rounded scientist, supported by computational tools.

As researchers, we often start by hacking together code scripts to get a quick result. But as simulations grow in complexity, “hacky” code becomes a liability. It becomes hard to debug, hard to reproduce, and impossible to scale.

The goal of this handbook is to document the transition from informal computational experimentation to systematic software engineering practices.

## 🎯 Objectives

1. **Reproducibility**  
   Move from manually executed, undocumented scripts to automated, version-controlled workflows.
   
3. **Robustness**  
   Learn tools (debuggers, unit tests, linters) that catch errors before they waste days of compute time.

4. **Efficiency**  
   Master the terminal and CLI workflow to run simulations on any machine (from laptop to cluster).

5. **Clarity**  
   Write code that my *future self* can read and understand six months from now.

## 🗂️ Structure

Each folder in this repository represents a specific skill or concept, containing a guide (`README.md`) and practical code examples.
